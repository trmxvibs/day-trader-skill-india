"""Source of truth for the Dhan Data block (see tools/sync_dhan_block.py): the open-source
live data client every price-reading skill carries, in place of the old Yahoo chart URL.
Each skill is a standalone script (a skill folder can be installed alone), so this block
is copied, not imported, the same way tools/nse_block.py is. Edit it here, then:

    python -B tools/sync_dhan_block.py          # rewrite the block in every script
    python -B tools/sync_dhan_block.py --check  # exit 1 if any copy differs (the tests run this)

This pack is open source: it runs for anyone, with or without their own setup. Three
tiers, tried in this order so it never just fails:

  1. --offline PATH, if you pass it: a saved chart-JSON file you made yourself (each
     skill's own parse_chart() takes the same shape it always has - see that skill's
     docstring and tools/build_nse_fixtures.py), from any broker's own chart, read by
     eye or a small export script of your own. Always wins when given: it is what you
     explicitly asked for.

  2. Dhan Data API (this block), if you have set it up. Needs a Dhan trading account
     plus the Data API add-on (dhan.co, a paid monthly subscription at the time of
     writing) and an access token generated from the Dhan web app (My Profile >
     DhanHQ Trading APIs). Set two environment variables, or trader/broker.json:
         DHAN_CLIENT_ID      your Dhan client ID
         DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN   the JWT access token (it expires; regenerate it on Dhan's site)
     API docs: https://dhanhq.co/docs/v2/historical-data/
     Security master (symbol -> securityId), public, no login needed:
     https://images.dhan.co/api-data/api-scrip-master.csv (the same file Dhan's own
     Python SDK downloads; reading it is not a scrape, it is Dhan's published data file)

  3. Yahoo's free chart endpoint, automatically, if neither of the above applies. No
     account, no key, nothing to set up - the same zero-setup experience the upstream
     US pack always had. A direct check against Dhan's own chart found Yahoo's NSE
     bars can be wrong (the 09:15 bar's high short by up to Rs 20.50, the day's high
     or low missing on 31-37% of days), so every skill prints YAHOO_FALLBACK_WARNING
     (below) each time it falls back to this tier. This is not a scrape: it is a
     plain, unauthenticated JSON endpoint.

This block never places an order and never touches funds; it only reads chart bars.
dhan_available() lets a skill check tier 2 quietly (no exception) before falling back
to tier 3.
